# Enyo 1 Sampler

Enyo was an open-source Javascript framework created for the Palm/HP TouchPad, and was later replaced with the cross platform Enyo2 (aka EnyoJS). While Enyo 1.0 was designed for webOS devices, with a few considerations, apps can run on LuneOS, in Chrome (or Chromium-based) browsers on the web, or with a little help from a Cordova wrapper, on modern Android phones.

This comes from a SDK sample that was shipped with the webOS SDK called Style Matters. It has been preserved for its historical value. The sample shows some of the UI features of the library, and works on modern Chromium-based browsers.

This build can be viewed at <http://www.webosarchive.com/enyo1sampler>.

Enyo was replaced by Enyo 2 (aka EnyoJS). A similar [sample app exists for that framework](https://github.com/codepoet80/enyo2-sampler).

Enyo 2 has been replaced by EnactJS, and is no longer updated.
